# `superjson-types`

This package provides accurate serialization and deserialization types for the popular package [SuperJSON]. It depends on SuperJSON as a peer-dependency, so make sure to install that as a dependency along with this.

Note: This package is unstable so I will change whatever I feel like whenever I feel like. So I might change the way the wrapper works or update the types to be more accurate without a major version bump.

Install: 

```
npm install superjson
npm install -D superjson-types
```
